            <h2 class="introduction">Hello, good to see you here!</h2>
            <h2 class="introduction">This is my explanation on how my challenge went when working with stable diffusion models for the first time.</h2>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2 class="steps">&#x2022 Step 1: Understanding Diffusion Models</h2>
            <br>
            <h4 class="step_text">We started with the research of understanding diffusion models.</h4>
            <h4 class="step_text">This was really interesting. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzxz8CO_oG4">This</a> explanation was the most clear and helped me with understanding the main use of stable diffusion.</h4>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2 class="steps">&#x2022 Step 2: Methods for Fine-Tuning Stable Diffusion</h2>
            <br>
            <h4 class="step_text">There were a lot of different Fine-Tining models that we could have chosen. But we found one that worked for us. This was very problematic at first because, the whole team thought we had to do it in Visual Studio Code. In the end I found out that we had a JupyterLab environment running for us. This was a game changer and we were now finally able to start. Without any GPU or CPU errors that we first encountered in Visual Studio Code. </h4>
            <br>
            <h4 class="step_text">The model that worked for us was given by the <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/fine-tuning-stable-diffusion-xl-with-dreambooth-and-lora">Data Camp tutorial.</a> This tutorial was easy to follow and gave us a lot of posibilities to improve our model.</h4>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2 class="steps">&#x2022 Step 3: Create a Dataset</h2>
            <br>
            <h4 class="step_text">For our dataset we wanted to use a pixel type game as a reference. This would make later creation easier and we thought it looked cute.</h4>
            <h4 class="step_text">Here are some of the pictures we used:</h4>
            <br>

            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2 class="steps">&#x2022 Step 4: Fine-tuning Stable Diffusion</h2>
            <br>
            <h4 class="step_text">The Fine-tuning was also shown in the <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/fine-tuning-stable-diffusion-xl-with-dreambooth-and-lora">Data Camp tutorial.</a> We did not use it and just used the normal model that was given. </h4>
            <h4 class="step_text">This is because we realized to late that we had to train it ourselfs. We just had way to many issues with even the setting up.</h4>
            <h4 class="step_text"> I really want to still do this so if i have time I will!</h4>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2 class="steps">&#x2022 Step 5: Evaluating the Results</h2>
            <br>
            <h4 class="step_text">So sadly here are the results of the normal model we used! Still glad that everything worked like we wanted.</h4>
            <br>
            <h4 class="step_text"><b>Mage:</b> <i>Cloaked in robes adorned with arcane symbols, the mage wielded her wand with grace, harnessing the power of magic to shape destinies and defy the darkeness</i></h4>
            <br>
            <h4 class="step_text"><b>Assasin:</b> <i>A shadow in the night, the assasin prowled the streets with silent footsteps, a master of stealth and deception, poised to strike with deadly precision.</i></h4>
            <br>
            <h4 class="step_text"><b>Orc:</b> <i>Towering over the landscape, the ogre brandished his mighty axes, a force of nature unleasehed upon the realm. With each swing, the earth trembled, and legends were born</i></h4>
            <br>
            <h4 class="step_text"><b>Viking:</b> <i>Clad in armor forged from the fires of battle, the viking stood as a guardian of pixelated realms his axe raised in defiance against the forces of chaos and tyranny.</i></h4>
